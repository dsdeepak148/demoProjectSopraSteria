Please go through the below points that how i have implemented the problem statement -- 

1.  The entire automation test has been implemented using Selenium using Java.

2.  Page Object Model is used as design pattern to build the entire automation
    framework with TestNG and Hybrid-driven testing approach.

3.  The project is developed as Maven Project.

4.  For reporting purpose, Extent Reports functionality is used.
